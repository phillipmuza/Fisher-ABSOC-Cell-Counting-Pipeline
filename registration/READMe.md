**Figure 1. Overview of brain slice registration. (A) Affine and b-spline transformations are applied to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (CCFv3) reference image to match brain slice autofluorescence image. Transformation parameters are produced after a successful transform (green arrow). (B) Transformation parameters generated in (A) are then applied to the CCFv3 annotations image, producing a transformed image spatially aligned to the brain slice autofluorescence image. (C) Transformed annotations from (B) aligns spatially with brain slice autofluorescence image (overlay) – allowing the experimenter to quantitatively assess anatomical regions within the brain slice.**
